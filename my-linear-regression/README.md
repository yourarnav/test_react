## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ Real-time parameter adjustment with smooth sliders
- ðŸ“Š Interactive scatter plot with regression lines
- ðŸŽ¨ Modern glassmorphic UI with beautiful gradients
- ðŸ“ˆ Live statistics (RÂ², MSE, best fit calculations)
- ðŸŽ¬ Animation mode for dynamic demonstrations
- ðŸ“± Fully responsive design

## Local Development

1. **Install Node.js** (if not already installed)
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **Install Dependencies**
